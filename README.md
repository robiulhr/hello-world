# Hello World
<p style="font-size:21px">Follow this Hello World exercise to get started with GitHub.</p> 

## Introduction

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.<br><br>This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests. You'll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub's pull request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.<br><br>In this quickstart guide, you will:<br><br>
- Create and use a repository
- Start and manage a new branch
- Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
- Open and merge a pull request <br><br>

To complete this tutorial, you need a  [GitHub account](https://github.com/) and Internet access. You don't need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software that GitHub is built on). If you have a question about any of the expressions used in this guide, head on over to the [glossary](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary) to find out more about our terminology.

## Creating a repository
A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets -- anything your project needs. Often, repositories include a README file, a file with information about your project. *README* files are written in the plain text Markdown language. You can use this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to get started with Markdown syntax. GitHub lets you add a README file at the same time you create your new repository. GitHub also offers other common options such as a license file, but you do not have to select any of them now.<br><br>Your `hello-world` repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

1. In the upper-right corner of any page, use the  drop-down menu, and select New repository.
